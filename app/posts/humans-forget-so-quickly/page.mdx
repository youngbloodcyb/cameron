# Humans Forget So Quickly

<Date>2024-04-24</Date>

I'm constantly baffled by how quick I am to forget. I'm not necessarily talking about forgetting things that I learned, although I'm very guilty of that too. I'm talking about how quickly I disregard the reality of experiences I've had.

Be it secular, physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual accomplishments, all validity of the experience seems to dissolve when followed by a trying impediment. Oh how easy it is to feel completely trodden when something goes wrong. Why does the human brain so easily surrender positive events to be overshadowed by difficulties?

Documenting experiences seems to be an antidote for me.
