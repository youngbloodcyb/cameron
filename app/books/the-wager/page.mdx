# The Wager

<Date>2023-01-14</Date>

**The Wager** was a great reminder of the brutality and hardships that previous generations had to endure that we are often blind to in the modern western world. It also instilled in my a furious curiosity to explore the history of my own ancestors to learn where they came from and what they experienced. Not to mention the strange desire it gave me to learn how to sail the ocean at some point in my life.
