My current setup for productivity tools
```
- macOS
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) macOS package manager
- [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) terminal w/ [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [cursor](https://cursor.com) IDE
    - [tokyo night light theme](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) (light mode is best)
    - prettier for code formatting
    ```
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "prettier.semi": true,
    "prettier.singleQuote": true,
    ```
- [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) w/ [claude code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
    - kick off agents in different branches to build multiple features at once in siloed environments
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (`cd` replacement)
- [maccy](https://maccy.app/) clipboard manager
- [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) window manager
- [orbstack](https://orbstack.dev) container runner
- lots of shortcut aliases in `.zshrc`

That's it for now. I will soon be journeying into adding vim bindings to Cursor.
