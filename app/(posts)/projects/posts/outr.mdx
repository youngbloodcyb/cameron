# Background

Every sales organization uses cold email outreach to generate and qualify leads. With Google adding stricter spam policies to Gmail, this becomes increasingly difficult to maintain positive domain ratings. 

Amidst all the Gmail chaos, [Bridger Tower](https://bridger.to) and I started to notice that sales teams were starting to send from multiple domains. That way, if a domain rating went south, they could dump it and move on to a new one.

Seeing this, we saw a market for creating a tool that allowed multi-domain sending along with automated outreach powered by AI.

# App Overview

Outr.ai is divided into a few parts:

## Contacts

A user can either upload a CSV of contacts or add them manually.

## Sequences

Users create sequences which make up the template for a workflow. Sequences are made up of `AI Nodes`, `Email Nodes`, and `Wait Nodes`. There is a templating system built into the sequence builder so that a user can pass field values from the contact info into the builder. Built in validations are an immediate feedback loop to ensure users build usable workflows.

## Domains

Users can configure many domains that they can send and receive emails from. After adding the domain, users are given the various DNS records to add. This allows Outr.ai to send and receive emails on their behalfâ€”fully managing the email infrastructure.

## Campaigns

With a sequence created and a domain configured, the user creates a campaign by selecting the sequence and sending domain.

The user can then add contacts to the campaign. Once contacts are added, AI scrapes the site of each contact and writes personalized emails based on the user's brand & product offering.

After the AI emails are written, the user has the option of viewing and editing the emails before sending.

Once the workflow is published, the emails will send to contacts based on the sequence structure previously created. The executed steps can be viewed individually for each contact.

## Replies

If the campaign goes well, contacts will reply to the emails and express interest. When a reply to one of the outreach emails is received, it can be seen in the `Replies` tab of the application. This is essentially a cross-domain inbox for all email replies.

The user can also reply directly within this interface and it will send from the original sending domain.

## Profiles

Finally, profiles allow the user to create different company / product profiles to give context to the AI. This is to give proper context when writing emails about your brand or offering.
