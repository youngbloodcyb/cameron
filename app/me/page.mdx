# About Me

My name is Cameron Youngblood.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing & advertising w/ minors in global business and korean language from Brigham Young University.

I'm a graduate student in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology w/ an emphasis in interactive and artificial intelligence.

I work full-time as a full stack engineer and spend my free time reading and learning new technologies. Professionally I use typescript, python, and AWS. Recently I've been learning Golang and playing around with embedded programming and ESP32 microprocessors.

Here are some of the relevant university and graduate courses I've taken over the years:

- Market Research
- Account Management & Sales
- Financial Management
- Financial & Managerial Accounting
- Advertising Campaign Strategy
- Market Research
- Design Thinking
- Probability & Statistics
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Trigonometry
- Object Oriented Programming
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Database Systems Architecture & Design
- International Business
- Analytical Modeling & Machine Learning
- Business Korean
- Human Computer Interaction
- Software Development Processes
- Artificial Intelligence
- Economics
- Search Engine Optimization
- Digital Analytics
- Digital Marketing

Despite a wide variety of coursework I've had the privilege of taking, I'm confident that a will for self-learning is far more important than acquiring degrees. Not everyone has the blessing of formal education, and anyone that learns skills on their own are worthy of accolades and career opportunities. We are incredibly lucky to live in a time where the world's knowledge is freely accessible through online videos and books, we just have to know where to look. There has _never_ been a better time in the history of the world to learn. It's a great time to be an autodidact.
